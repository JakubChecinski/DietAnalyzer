# DietAnalyzer
An ASP.NET Core MVC project to manage and analyze your diets
</br>
Registered users can build their own dietary plans using example library foods as well as their own custom foods. Each diet can be evaluated by the application algorithm, which will try to offer nutrition comments and suggest possible improvements. Various dietary restrictions can be included in order to further customize the obtained feedback. Additionally, the users can create and manage their own units of measure, which may be convenient for some types of food. 
</br>
Apart from the main project, the solution also includes unit and integration tests, covering majority (though not 100%) of the app. The tests have been written using the NUnit framework.
</br>
Demo of the application is available at https://jakubchecinskiapp.azurewebsites.net (registered users only; please contact checinski.j@gmail.com first in order to obtain a test account)
